      As a dedicated Software Developer with a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science, I bring a diverse skill set and a passion for solving complex problems. My expertise spans Python and web development.

In my recent role at Detect Technologies, I developed Python plugins to streamline synthetic data generation using OpenCV and instance segmentation, significantly improving data processing efficiency. My contributions extended to automating image and video generation, showcasing my ability to enhance scalability and performance.

At Pearl Lemon, I focused on optimizing web applications for mobile devices, implementing UI/UX improvements, and leveraging JavaScript for dynamic user interactions. My work ensured seamless functionality across platforms, creating intuitive and responsive digital experiences.

My project portfolio includes a blockchain-based vehicle supply chain system, where I implemented smart contracts and developed a MetaMask interface for real-time transaction monitoring. Additionally, I created "TextMiner," a textual analysis tool, and "WeatherGuard," a weather incident analysis application using Python, demonstrating my proficiency in data analysis and visualization.

With technical skills in Python, JavaScript, Django, and various other technologies. I am always eager to explore new opportunities and contribute to innovative projects.
